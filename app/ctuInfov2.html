			<p>The United States Navy's "Sea, Air, and Land" Teams, commonly abbreviated as the Navy SEALs,
			are the U.S. Navy's primary special operations force and a component of the Naval Special 
			Warfare Command. Among the SEALs' main functions are conducting small-unit maritime military 
			operations that originate from, and return to, a river, ocean, swamp, delta, or coastline. The SEALs are
			trained to operate in all environments (Sea, Air, and Land) for which they are named.</p>
